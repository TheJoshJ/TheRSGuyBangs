# How It Works
**1. Data Collection**

To count the number of times "bang" is said, we use a custom-built JavaScript script that:

- Fetches YouTube's autogenerated captions from TheRSGuy’s VOD and video channels.
- Parses the captions and extracts relevant data.
- Generates a JSON file containing a Video/VOD title, YouTube video ID, The number of times "bang" was said, Timestamps for each instance


Due to scraper limitations when hosted externally, this process runs on a self-hosted server and the results are sent to our backend service that is cloud hosted.

**2. Data Processing & API**

Once the JSON files are generated, they are sent to our backend service via a POST request. This backend is hosted in the cloud alongside the React frontend and exposes four key endpoints:

#### Live Status
Returns a boolean indicating if TheRSGuy is currently live on Twitch (via the Twitch API)
```http
  GET /api/v1/live
```

#### Bangs
Totals the "bang" count from all videos and returns the cumulative total.
```http
  GET /api/v1/bangs
```

#### Videos
Returns an array of all processed YouTube videos with "bang" counts and timestamps.
```http
  GET /api/v1/videos
```

#### Vods
Returns an array of all processed VOD's with "bang" counts and timestamps.
```http
  GET /api/v1/vods
```

**3. Data Format**

Each video record follows this structure:

```typescript
VideoRecord {
  source?: "videos" | "vods";
  videoId: string;
  title: string;
  publishedAt: string;
  fileName: string;
  bang_count: number;
  bangs: [
    {
      timestamp: number;
      transcript: string;
    }
  ];
}
```
This structure is initially generated by the scraper, which is then sent to the backend service and served to the client.
